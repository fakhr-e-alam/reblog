    title: 'The Register: Devs sound alarm after Microsoft subtracts C/C++ extension from VS Code forks',
    author: 'Thomas Claburn',
    content: `A major shake-up in the open-source editor landscape occurred when Microsoft restricted access to its C/C++ extension for forks of Visual Studio Code, 
      including popular alternatives like VSCodium. In this article, Thomas Claburn captures the developer community's reaction to this change, 
      examining its implications for open-source integrity and software freedom. Interviews with contributors and maintainers highlight the 
      growing tension between proprietary interests and the spirit of open development. The post also explores the licensing decisions behind the 
      move and what it might mean for developers relying on free, unbranded versions of VS Code. This piece offers both historical context and a look ahead 
      at how this decision could reshape extension ecosystems in code editors.`
