## Features

- 🎨 Modern Glass-morphism UI Design
- 📱 Fully Responsive Layout
- 🔐 User Authentication with Redis Session Management
- 📂 Category-based Blog Organization
- 👤 Author Profiles with Expertise Tags
- 🔍 Blog Search Functionality
- 💾 Redis Data Persistence
- 🚀 Docker Support for Development and Production
- 🔄 Real-time Author-Blog Relationship
- 🎯 Optimized Performance with Redis Caching

## Tech Stack:

- **Frontend:**
  - React.js
  - React Router v6
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Axios for API calls
  - Glass-morphism UI components

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js with Express.js
  - Redis for data storage and caching
  - Docker containerization
  - RESTful API architecture

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Redis (automatically handled by Docker)
- Git for version control

## Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install frontend dependencies
   npm install

   # Install backend dependencies
   cd src/backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the application using Docker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will start:
   - Frontend on http://localhost:3000
   - Backend on http://localhost:5000
   - Redis on port 6379

### Production Deployment

1. Build and run using production configuration:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

   This will start:
   - Frontend on port 80 (Nginx)
   - Backend on port 5000
   - Redis (internal access only)
